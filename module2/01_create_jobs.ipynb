    "# Module 2: Creating CML Jobs Programmatically\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Module 1, you built a complete ML pipeline using Python scripts executed manually. In Module 2, we'll automate this pipeline using **CML Jobs** - scheduled or triggered tasks that run your scripts at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook teaches you how to **create jobs programmatically** using the CML API. Instead of clicking through the UI, you'll write code to define, configure, and manage jobs. This approach enables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automation**: Create multiple jobs with consistent configurations\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: Version control your job definitions\n",
    "- **Integration**: Orchestrate complex workflows programmatically\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Deploy jobs across projects and environments\n",
    "- **GitOps**: Store job definitions in version control\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ How to authenticate with CML API\n",
    "2. ✅ How to query available ML runtimes\n",
    "3. ✅ How to retrieve project metadata\n",
    "4. ✅ How to define a job using `cmlapi.CreateJobRequest`\n",
    "5. ✅ How to create jobs programmatically\n",
    "6. ✅ How to configure job dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: We will **create** jobs but not **run** them in this notebook. Running jobs will be covered separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Module 2 Job Pipeline Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook creates **2 jobs** that work together in a monitoring pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Job 1: Prepare Artificial Data\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "    └─→ Creates training dataset\n",

    "Job 2: Monitor Pipeline\n",
    "    ├─ Period 0: Get predictions → Load ground truth → Check model\n",
    "    ├─ Period 1: Get predictions → Load ground truth → Check model\n",
    "    ├─ Period 2: Get predictions → Load ground truth → Check model\n",
    "    └─ ... (repeats for all periods)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key difference from previous design:\n",
    "- **Old**: 4 jobs with manual state passing and job chaining\n",
    "- **New**: 2 jobs with self-contained period management in Job 2\n",

    "   - Select \"Run Now\"\n",
    "   - The job will process all periods sequentially\n",
    "   - Check results in data/monitoring_results.json\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Option B - Run via API (next notebook):\n",
    "   - Use client.create_job_run() to trigger Job 1\n",
    "   - Wait for completion\n",
    "   - Use client.create_job_run() to trigger Job 2\n",

    "Key Advantages of This Design:\n",
    "   • Simpler: Only 2 jobs instead of 4\n",
    "   • Reliable: No job chaining failures or state passing issues\n",
    "   • Faster: No overhead from starting multiple jobs\n",
    "   • Cleaner logs: All output in one execution\n",
    "   • Self-contained: No external state file dependencies\n",
    "   • Flexible: Can run specific period ranges via command-line args\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Learning Points:\n",
    "   • Jobs are created once, run many times\n",
    "   • Each run can have different environment variables or arguments\n",
    "   • Job names help identify jobs programmatically\n",
    "   • cmlapi enables GitOps workflows for job management\n",
    "   • This 2-job pipeline automates the complete monitoring workflow\n",
    "   • Period state is managed internally, not via external files\n",

    "## Key Concepts Review\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authentication\n",
    "```python\n",
    "client = cmlapi.default_client(\n",
    "    url=os.getenv(\"CDSW_API_URL\").replace(\"/api/v1\", \"\"),\n",
    "    cml_api_key=os.getenv(\"CDSW_APIV2_KEY\")\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "CML automatically provides API credentials in environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting Runtimes\n",
    "```python\n",
    "available_runtimes = client.list_runtimes(\n",
    "    search_filter=json.dumps({\"kernel\": \"Python 3.10\"})\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Query available ML Runtimes with specific configurations (Python version, GPU, editor).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Jobs\n",
    "```python\n",
    "job_body = cmlapi.CreateJobRequest(\n",
    "    project_id=project.id,\n",
    "    name=\"Job Name\",\n",
    "    script=\"script.py\",\n",
    "    cpu=2,\n",
    "    memory=4,\n",
    "    runtime_identifier=runtime_id,\n",
    "    environment={\"VAR\": \"value\"}\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "job = client.create_job(body=job_body, project_id=project.id)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Define job configuration and create it in CML (does NOT run automatically).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Internal State Management (New Design)\n",
    "Instead of passing state between jobs via environment variables and job chaining:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# OLD (4 jobs): Job1 → triggers Job2 → triggers Job3 → triggers Job4\n",
    "# NEW (2 jobs): Job1 → Job2 processes all periods internally\n",
    "\n",
    "# Job 2 (Monitor Pipeline) manages period state:\n",
    "for period in range(START_PERIOD, END_PERIOD + 1):\n",
    "    # Phase 1: Get Predictions\n",
    "    # Phase 2: Load Ground Truth\n",
    "    # Phase 3: Check Model\n",
    "    # Decision: Continue or exit\n",
    "```\n",
    "Period state is managed in-memory within a single job execution.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Summary: The 2-Job Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "You've just created a simplified, production-grade monitoring pipeline using CML Jobs:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Job | Purpose | Runs |\n",
    "|-----|---------|------|\n",
    "| 1 | Prepare synthetic data | Once (one-time setup) |\n",
    "| 2 | Monitor all periods | Once (processes all periods sequentially) |\n",
    "\n",
    "This is simpler and more reliable than the original 4-job design while maintaining all the same functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Original Design (4 Jobs)**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Job 1: Prepare Data\n",
    "   ↓ triggers\n",
    "Job 2: Get Predictions (Period 0)\n",
    "   ↓ triggers\n",
    "Job 3: Load Ground Truth (Period 0)\n",
    "   ↓ triggers\n",
    "Job 4: Check Model (Period 0)\n",
    "   ↓ triggers\n",
    "Job 2: Get Predictions (Period 1)\n",
    "   ↓ ... (repeats for each period)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Problems: State passing, job chaining failures, multiple job executions, complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "**New Design (2 Jobs)**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Job 1: Prepare Data (one-time)\n",
    "   ↓ manual trigger\n",
    "Job 2: Monitor Pipeline\n",
    "   ├─ for period in [0, 1, 2, ...]:\n",
    "   │   ├─ Get Predictions\n",
    "   │   ├─ Load Ground Truth\n",
    "   │   └─ Check Model\n",
    "   └─ (single execution, all periods handled)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Advantages: Self-contained, reliable, simple, maintainable, fast\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, you'll:\n",
    "1. Learn how to **run jobs** using `client.create_job_run()`\n",
    "2. Monitor job execution and track progress\n",
    "3. Handle errors and job failures\n",
    "4. Implement the complete automated monitoring pipeline"
